<h1 align="center">Core Java</h1>
<p>This repository consists of the basics of Java. For covering the core concepts of Java I followed <a href="http://www.trainingwithliveproject.com/p/java-tutorials.html"><b>Training with Live Project</b></a>. This tutorials are in bengali language which is my mother tongue. I want to thanks Md. Abdul Bari sir who has illustrated all the concepts so much easily and practically where anyone can understand those tutorials.<br> <br>In this repository all the codes are segmented with class number and you can find out which class is covering which topic from the below list. But primarily there are two hierarchy. One is a some files with codes which I executed from command line which you can see at first with some class number. Another is a project folder named <b>Core Java</b> where the rest of the codes lies. You can see the codes here <b>"Core-Java/Core Java/src/"</b> or clone the repository in your local driver and open the project with IDE such as <b>NetBeans</b>.</p>
